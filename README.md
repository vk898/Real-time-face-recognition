A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces. Face recognition is a way of recognize a human face through technology and is one of the most widely used technology for human identification.
Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection. This method was proposed 
by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted
Cascade of Simple Features . Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot 
of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier. Initially, the algorithm needs a 
lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the 
classifier. Then we need to extract features from it.
